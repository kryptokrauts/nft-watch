# NFT Watch DAO

NFT Watch DAO was launched in November of 2021 by various members in the [Proton](https://proton.org) community. It is a self-organized initiative to detect scams and prevent other community members from buying fraudulent NFTs. Initially, all reports and judgements about different collections have been handled in the [official Telegram group](https://t.me/protonnftwatch).

At the end of September 2022, The team of [Soon.Market](https://soon.market) received a [developer grant](https://www.proton.org/wps-developer-grants) by Proton to build a proposed application which supports this effort.

In November 2022, a scammer was able to trick some community members and hosted different fake auctions for the [Proton DEX Keys](https://soon.market/collections/353512453544) which provide lifetime fee-less trading on the new Proton DEX. The Soon.Market team immediately took action and announced to [fight the scammers](https://medium.com/soonmarket/fighting-the-scammers-announcing-whitelisting-governed-by-proton-nft-watch-6dca0cacbfed) by introducing shielded NFT collections earlier than originally planned.

Currently, the shielding and blacklisting process is governed in the official Soon.Market [Discord](https://discord.gg/KtVVaYy6b3).

This repository contains content that explains in detail how NFT Watch is governed. Additionally, various diagrams within the repository serve as a basis of discussion before the decentralized application for NFT Watch will be developed.
