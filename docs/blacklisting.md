# Blacklisting

In general, all NFT collections that violate the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md) are considered to be blacklisted.

## How does the blacklisting process look like?

### 1. Report

Any community member can report an NFT collection that potentially violates the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md) by reporting it in the `#ðŸš©ï¸±blacklist-report ` channel on the Soon.Market [Discord](https://discord.gg/KtVVaYy6b3).

### 2.1 Guard Check

A [Guard](./roles.md#guard) will perform a check on the reported NFT collection:

- if the NFT collection is a clear rip-off, it [Guards](./roles.md#guard) will put the NFT collection on the blacklist
- if the NFT collection is assumed to be a knock-off, a Yellow Tier Vote will be opened by the [Guards](./roles.md#guard) to decide whether the NFT collection will be blacklisted or not
- if no violation is detected, no action will be taken

### 2.2 Yellow Tier Vote (if required)

If the reported NFT collection is considered to be a knock-off, a Yellow Tier Vote will be opened. The NFT Watch DAO [Voters](./roles.md#voter) will determine whether the NFT collection should will be blacklisted or not.

*Note:*

- *Currently, the Yellow Tier Vote is anonymous, open for 1 week and its result is based on majority of at least 21 participants. In case there are less than 21 participants, the NFT collection won't be blacklisted*

### 3. Blacklisting

In case off a rip-off (determined by Guards) or a knock-off (confirmed by Voters), the NFT collection will be added to the blacklist.
