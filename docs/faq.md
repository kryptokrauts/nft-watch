## What is the difference between copy paste scams and knock-off assumptions? Why are they treated differently? How does NFT Watch DAO make the determination?

Copy paste scams are clear blatant rip-offs of other images or NFT collections that have little to no changes.

Assumed knock-offs are generally very close to the original source material but are altered to fool investors into thinking it is genuine. NFT Watch DAO check lines, shading, angles and pixel alignment to determine whether or not a project has been ripped off opposed to a knock-off.

As most knock-off NFT collections are assumed without direct concrete proof, the [Guards](./guards.md) will try to contact the creator and clarify the case before taking any action. For rip-off scams, the [Guards](./guards.md) will make immediate determination and put the NFT collection on the blacklist.

## How does NFT Watch DAO treat wash trading & “rug pulls”?

These kinds of activities are out of the scope of the NFT Watch DAO initiative!

There is no clear definition of the term “rug pull” which means it’s a subjective opinion of every individual. Based on our experience, so-called “rug pulls” are an emotional and controversial topic.

We believe that every NFT marketplace should handle such topics individually based on their own rules.
