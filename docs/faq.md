# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is there a token for NFT Watch DAO?

NO, please be cautious of imposters!

## Will there be a token for NFT Watch DAO in the future?

NFT Watch DAO established a governance model where no token is required. Currently, there are no plans to introduce a token.

## What is the difference between copy paste scams and knock-off assumptions? Why are they treated differently? How does NFT Watch DAO make the determination?

Copy paste scams are clear blatant rip-offs of other images or NFT collections that have little to no changes.

Assumed knock-offs are generally very close to the original source material but are altered to fool investors into thinking it is genuine. NFT Watch DAO check lines, shading, angles and pixel alignment to determine whether or not a project has been ripped off opposed to a knock-off.

As most knock-off NFT collections are assumed without direct concrete proof, [Voters](./roles.md#voter) decide on this determination. For rip-off scams, [Guards](./roles.md#guard) will make immediate determination and put the NFT collection on the blacklist.

## Can the shield be removed from an NFT collection?

When members in the community raise their concerns about a specific NFT collection mentioning that it violates the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md), a [Guard](./roles.md#guard) will try to contact the creator or the lead of the team behind the NFT collection and remedy the situation. If the issue is not fixed, the [Guards](./roles.md#guard) can remove the NFT collection with a majority vote among the [Guards](./roles.md#guard).

## How does NFT Watch DAO treat wash trading & ‚Äúrug pulls‚Äù?

These kinds of activities are out of the scope of the NFT Watch DAO initiative!

There is no clear definition of the term ‚Äúrug pull‚Äù which means it‚Äôs a subjective opinion of every individual. Based on our experience, so-called ‚Äúrug pulls‚Äù are an emotional and controversial topic.

We believe that every NFT marketplace should handle such topics individually based on their own rules.

## How can marketplaces fetch information about shielded and blacklisted NFT collections?

On request, the Soon.Market team will provide other marketplaces access to these lists.

However, in the future both lists will be written on-chain and thus fully transparent for everybody interested in consuming it.

## What is the relationship of NFT Watch DAO to Soon.Market?

The NFT Watch DAO initiative exists longer than Soon.Market and aims to be 100% **independent** of any **marketplace**.

The team behind Soon.Market helped NFT Watch with setting up the right process and implementing a solution which eventually becomes 100% decentralized and governed by the NFT Watch DAO.

For the moment, discussions, voting and reporting are handled in the Soon.Market Discord and Soon.Market is the first marketplace which integrates the information about shielded and blacklisted NFT collections governed by NFT Watch.
