# Guards

Guards are a set of motivated and trustworthy members in the community that lead the NFT Watch DAO initiative.

## Responsibilities
The core reponsibility of Guards is to make sure that the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md) is followed. NFT collections which do not follow it, will be blacklisted by NFT Watch DAO. The community is encouraged to support the Guards by reporting such collections, see [blacklisting](./blacklisting.md).

In addition to that, Guards perform background checks on NFT collections upon request. This background check is called [shielding](./shielding.md) and can be requested by anybody for a specific NFT collection.

## Authorizations in Smart Contract
All Guards are maintained in a [Smart Contract](./smart-contract.md) and authorized to perform various actions which need their authorization. Only guards are allowed to maintain the blacklist & shieldings of NFT collections.

## Compensation
Being a Guard is mainly a voluntary task. However, for reviewing shielding requests and creating the report which will be published for each request, the Guard will receive a portion of the fee paid by the requester.
