# Introduction

NFT Watch DAO was launched in November of 2021 by various members in the [XPR Network](https://xprnetwork.org) community. It is a self-organized initiative to detect scams and prevent other community members from buying fraudulent NFTs.

Initially, all reports and judgements about different collections have been handled in the [official Telegram group](https://t.me/nftwatchdao) only. Marketplaces had to keep track of the activities of NFT Watch DAO and manually add collections to their blacklist.

In November 2022, a scammer was able to trick some community members and hosted different fake auctions for the [Proton DEX Keys](https://soon.market/collections/353512453544) which provide lifetime fee-less trading on the Proton DEX which is nowadays known as [Metal X](https://metalx.com). The team behind [Soon.Market](https://soon.market) immediately took action and announced to [fight the scammers](https://medium.com/soonmarket/fighting-the-scammers-announcing-whitelisting-governed-by-proton-nft-watch-6dca0cacbfed) by introducing shielded NFT collections with the help of NFT Watch DAO.

Since February 2024, NFT Watch DAO processes are governed via [Smart Contract](./smart-contract.md) and can be embraced by any NFT marketplace.
