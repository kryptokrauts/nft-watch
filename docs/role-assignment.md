# Role Assignment

## Scout

This is an **implicit role**, meaning that **every** community member is automatically considered to be a Scout.

## Voter

To obtain this role, community members need to:

1. Join the Soon.Market [Discord](https://discord.gg/KtVVaYy6b3)
1. Send 1 XPR to the account [nftwatch](https://www.protonscan.io/account/nftwatch) with the message `voter <discord-handle>`
    - [Example transaction](https://www.protonscan.io/transaction/6701e4a17965472e5e90348dcae42cf61d9b3796e13bd7de285f0654c81975c8)
1. Ask a [Guard](./roles.md#guard) to assign the role on Discord in the `#apply-for-voter-role` channel

*Note:*

- *Discord-handle **MUST** include the id (e.g. “protonGuy#1234”)*
- *The Proton account used to apply for the role by sending the transaction as mentioned above, must have had their first activity at least *3 months ago* - considering the time of the transaction*

## Guard

Initially, a set of motivated and trustworthy members in the community have been assigned with that role. Every community member can indicate their interest in becoming a [Guard](./roles.md#guard) in the chat or via DM to an existing Guard. The Guards will then have to find consensus and make a decision.
