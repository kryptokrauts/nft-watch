# Shielding

## What is the purpose of shielding?

By handing out the shield, NFT Watch DAO confirms that an NFT collection:

- is NOT violating the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md)
- passes the [Basic Check](./shielding.md#basic-check)
- has enough supporters in the community
    - projects / teams as well as individuals interested in an NFT collection need to convince other community members with the [Voter](./roles.md#voter) role to upvote on a shielding proposal of their NFT collection

*Note: Shielding is only targeting NFT collections, not individual accounts!*

## Basic Check

Before a [Guard](./roles.md#guard) starts a vote for an NFT collection to get shielded, the collection needs to pass the basic check.

### Requirements

An NFT collection needs to meet following requirements :

- age of first mint > 1 month
- min. 25 unique NFTs
- min. 10 unique holders (excluding accounts like `atomicmarket`, `token.burn`, ...)
- min. 10 unique buyers (only holders that bought an NFT are counted)

## How does the shielding process look like?

### 1. Proposal submission

Any community member can propose an NFT collection to be shielded in the by creating a post in the `#ðŸ›¡ï¸±shielding-proposal ` channel on the Soon.Market [Discord](https://discord.gg/KtVVaYy6b3).

### 2.1 Basic Check

A [Guard](./roles.md#guard) will perform a basic check on the proposed NFT collection. Only if the Basic Check is passed, the Guard will open a shielding vote for the NFT collection.

### 2.2 Yellow Tier Vote (if required)

In some cases, even if the Basic Check passes, a Yellow Tier Vote is required. If the NFT collection seems to be a knock-off of an existing NFT collection, the NFT Watch DAO [Voters](./roles.md#voter) first need to determine whether the NFT collection should get the chance to get shielded or not.

*Note:*

- *Currently, the Yellow Tier Vote is anonymous, open for 1 week and its result is based on majority of at least 21 participants. In case there are less than 21 participants, the Shielding Process will be considered as a fail and the NFT collection can again be proposed for shielding after a period of 1 month.*

### 3. Shielding Vote

Once a [Guard](./roles.md#guard) opened the Shielding Vote, all [Voters](./roles.md#voter) will have the opportunity to vote for the NFT collection to be shielded.

*Note: The Shielding Vote will be open for exactly 1 week and in order to pass, an NFT collection needs at least 21 upvotes.*

### 4. Activate Shield

If the Shielding Vote has at least 21 supporters within the voting period of 1 week, the shield will be activated on the NFT collection!
