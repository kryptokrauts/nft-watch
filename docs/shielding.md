# Shielding

## What is the purpose of shielding?

By handing out the shield, NFT Watch DAO confirms that an NFT collection:

- is NOT violating the [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md)
- passes the [Basic Check](./shielding.md#basic-check)
- has enough supporters in the community
    - projects / teams as well as individuals interested in an NFT collection need to convince other community members with the [Voter](./roles.md#voter) role to upvote on a shielding proposal of their NFT collection

*Note: Shielding is only targeting NFT collections, not individual accounts!*

## Basic Check

Before a [Guard](./roles.md#guard) starts a vote for an NFT collection to get shielded, the collection needs to pass the basic check.

### Requirements

An NFT collection needs to meet following requirements :

- age of first mint > 1 month
- min. 25 unique NFTs
- min. 10 unique holders (excluding accounts like `atomicmarket`, `token.burn`, ...)
- min. 10 unique buyers (only holders that bought an NFT are counted)

## How does the shielding process look like?

### 1. Proposal submission

Any community member can propose an NFT collection to be shielded in the by creating a post in the `#ðŸ›¡ï¸±shielding-proposal ` channel on the Soon.Market [Discord](https://discord.gg/KtVVaYy6b3).

### 2.1 Basic Check

The [Guards](./roles.md#guard) will perform a basic check on the proposed NFT collection. Only if the Basic Check is passed, the [Guards](./roles.md#guard) will open a shielding vote for the NFT collection.

#### Exceptions & Special treatments

There exist cases where the general Basic Check requirements cannot be applied, but the NFT collection can and should still be considered to receive a shield:

1. "Official" NFT collections where it is likely, that scammers try to create copies and trick the community. A prominent example for this are [Proton DEX Keys](https://soon.market/collections/353512453544), where scammers unfortunately were able to collect funds before shielding existed.
1. NFT collections that are closely related to already shielded NFT collections. Few examples:
    - Secondary NFT collections that provide utility such as discounts, requests for custom creations, ...
    - NFT collections that have been distributed as an airdrop for an NFT collection that has already been shielded.

*Note: It is upon the [Guards](./roles.md#guard) to decide, if an NFT collection falls under this category. If the [Guards](./roles.md#guard) agree, they start a Shielding Vote as usual.*

### 2.2 Yellow Tier Vote (if required)

In some cases, even if the Basic Check passes, a Yellow Tier Vote is required. If conflicts with NFT collections such as IP issues or other controversal grey area issues like knock-offs are assumed, a Yellow Tier Vote will be opened to determine whether the NFT collection should get the chance to get shielded or not.

*Note:*

- *If the Yellow Tier Vote is successful, the [Guards](./roles.md#guard) will open a Shielding Vote right after.*
- *If the Yellow Tier Vote fails, the [Guards](./roles.md#guard) will put the NFT collection directly in to the blacklist!*
- *If the Yellow Tier Vote doesn't receive the required participation rate, nothing happens and the NFT collection can be proposed to get shielded again after 1 month.*
- *No matter about the outcome of the Yellow Tier Vote, the NFT collection will receive a Yellow Tier Flag from [Guards](./roles.md#guard) with a text that describes the assumed IP issue or other grey area issue.*
- *Currently, the Yellow Tier Vote is anonymous, open for 1 week and its result is based on majority of at least 21 participants. In case there are less than 21 participants, the Shielding Process will be considered as a fail and the NFT collection can again be proposed for shielding after a period of 1 month.*

### 3. Shielding Vote

Once a [Guard](./roles.md#guard) opened the Shielding Vote, all [Voters](./roles.md#voter) will have the opportunity to vote for the NFT collection to be shielded.

*Note: The Shielding Vote will be open for exactly 1 week and in order to pass, an NFT collection needs at least 21 upvotes.*

### 4. Activate Shield

If the Shielding Vote has at least 21 supporters within the voting period of 1 week, the shield will be activated on the NFT collection!
