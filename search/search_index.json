The Soon.Market team immediately took action and announced to fight the scammers by introducing shielded NFT collections earlier than originally planned.</p> <p>Currently, the shielding and blacklisting process is governed in the official Soon.Market Discord.</p> <p>This repository contains content that explains in detail how NFT Watch is governed.
